            **Should Your Cat Be Watching Cat TV?**

            Why not, really? Long before streaming platforms and smart TVs became part of everyday life, cats
            entertained themselves by perching in trees or sitting by the window, quietly observing birds, insects, and
            the world outside. In a way, they had their own version of “live TV.” And honestly, children used to do the
            same — watching the street, the sky, or people passing by.

            Today, as screen time has become normal for both humans and pets, some cats are also getting used to digital
            entertainment. “Cat TV” — videos made especially for cats, often featuring birds, squirrels, fish, or moving
            shapes — can stimulate their natural hunting instincts. The movement and sounds grab their attention and can
            provide mental enrichment, especially for indoor cats who may not have much environmental stimulation.

            However, it shouldn’t replace real-world experiences. Watching birds on a screen is engaging, but it’s not
            the same as feeling the breeze from an open window or tracking real movement outside. Cats still benefit
            greatly from physical play, climbing, scratching posts, and interactive toys. Screen time should be a
            supplement, not a substitute.

            It’s also important to monitor your cat’s reaction. Some cats become excited but relaxed afterward, while
            others may feel frustrated if they cannot “catch” the prey on the screen. Keeping sessions short and pairing
            them with interactive play can help balance things out.

            So, should your cat watch Cat TV? In moderation, it can be a fun and enriching activity — just one more
            modern way for curious felines to explore their world, while still enjoying their favourite spots by the
            window.
